I have found Project Euler a helpful tool to learn basic programming structure and most importantly, how to come up with quicker algorithms. A lot of the problems cannot be solved with brute force - the rule of thumb is if it takes the computer longer than 1 minute to run the program, there is a better way to solve it.
